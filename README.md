# -Civ-5-Religion-Overhaul
A mod that changes the way religion spreads in civ 5
Desired features:
  - Missionaries do not suffer attrition in a city that is the same religion as them
  - Bigger cities exert more religious pressure than smaller cities
    - If a city contains 6 citizens of religion A and 3 of religion B, that city 
      should exert both religions A and B onto surrounding cities, but with A being 3x as strong as B.

*I never ended up working seriously on this mod but it would be amazing if anyone would be able to create it*
